title: about-me
bio: >-
  I was born and raised in Mexico, a beautiful country with rolling plains and
  stacked cities. Although I never picked up a camera while I lived there,
  Mexico instilled a love of art and beauty in me. As I grew older, children
  became a passion of mine. I love how a child can find fun in anything, and
  their innocence represented beauty to me.


  The day came when I had a child of my own, and all I wanted to was capture
  each and every moment that brought a smile (or a frown) to her face. And
  that's how photogarropy started! Each time I shared photos of my own, I would
  have friends asking if I could photograph their family or their children.


  I'm beyond excited that my favorite hobby has turned into a small business,
  and I look forward to capturing the memories that you cherish most!
